\begin{abstract}
Reachable set computation tools for hybrid systems approximate the reachable set over an interval of time with a symbolic representation. 
Most reachable set computation tools implement some form of aggregation for handling discrete transitions. However, such aggregation generate very conservative overapproximations, which are not useful in inferring the safety properties. If such an aggregation is not performed, then one has to keep track of exponential number of symbolic representations and hence suffer from computational drawbacks.

In this paper we present a new data structure called Aggregated Directed Acyclic Graph (AGGDAG) for keeping track of reachable sets. Using AGGDAG, we present a new deaggregation technique for performing selective deaggregation. Our deaggregation strategy is guided by counterexamples and hence provides completeness guarantees for safety verification. We present a case study of inferring safety properties of satellite rendezvous and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

% For handling discrete transitions, 
% One of the major challenges in computing reachable set for hybrid systems computation is to handle the discrete transitions. 

% Most reachable set computation tools implement some form of aggregation.
