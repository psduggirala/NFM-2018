\begin{abstract}
  Computing the set of reachable states is a widely used technique for proving that a hybrid system satisfies its safety specification.
  %
  Flow-pipe construction methods interleave phases of computing continuous successors and phases of computing discrete successors.
%   are computed.
  %
  Directly doing this leads to a combinatorial explosion problem, though, as with each discrete successor there may be an interval of time
  where the transition can occur, so that the number of paths becomes exponential in the number of discrete transitions.
  %
  For this reason, most reachable set computation tools implement some form of set aggregation for discrete transitions, such as, performing a
  template-based overapproximation or convex hull aggregation.
  %
  These aggregation methods, however, in theory can lead to unbounded error, and in practice are often
  the root cause of why a safety specification cannot be proven.

%$~~$
  This paper proposes techniques for improving the accuracy of the aggregation operations performed for reachable set computation.
  %
  First, we present two aggregation strategies over generalized stars, namely convex hull aggregation and template based aggregation.
  %
  Second, we perform adaptive deaggregation using a data structure called Aggregated Directed Acyclic Graph (AGGDAG).
  %
  Our deaggregation strategy is driven by counterexamples and hence has soundness and relative completeness guarantees.
  %
  We demonstrate the computational benefits of our approach through \new{two case studies involving satellite rendezvous and gearbox meshing}.

\section{Conclusions}
%\vspace{-0.4cm}
In this paper we have focused on computing accurate reachable set computation of hybrid automata where there is high nondeterminism in the discrete transitions. We presented two common techniques used for aggregation and highlighted the relative merits and demerits of each technique. We also presented AGGDAG data structure and outlined the deaggregation strategies that were implemented. Using the techniques we were able to handle the challenging case studies of satellite rendezvous mission and gearbox meshing.

Handling discrete transitions is still a major hurdle in scalable and accurate computation of reachable set for linear hybrid systems. As a part of future work, we intend to explore intelligent aggregation and deaggregation strategies that adapt based on the dynamics to provide an accurate reachable set.
