\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Aeronautical systems such as air-traffic control protocols, auto-pilot software, and satellite maneuver protocols are safety critical in nature.
%
Bugs in such systems can lead to many unsafe scenarios, causing loss of property and in some cases, life.
%
Testing such systems extensively under various scenarios often provides the system designer and the user with confidence that the systems functions in a safe manner.
%
However, such extensive testing is not always possible. 
%has its own set of challenges.
%
%For systems such as air-traffic control protocols, testing the protocols under various scenarios is an expensive endeavour.
%
In the case of satellite maneuver protocols, it is impossible to create a controlled test bed on earth to test such systems.
%
Moreover, once deployed, updates to the control algorithms on satellite maneuver protocols is very difficult, if not impossible.
%
%
One of the widely used method for ensuring that the system does not encounter any unsafe scenarios in such cases is model-based analysis.
%
In this method, a high-fidelity model of the system is created and extensive testing and verification is performed on the model.
%
% Model-based analysis is also helpful in reducing the number of test scenarios of the system.
%
% It is particularly well suited for satellite maneuver protocols as creating a test bed for such systems is impossible.
% 
% 
Hybrid automata is a well suited framework for modeling such safety critical systems and formal verification approaches for proving safety properties of several aeronautical systems modeled as a hybrid automata are widely available in the literature~\cite{tomlin1998conflict,pallottino2002conflict,prabhakar2009verifying,johnson2012satellite,munoz2013tcas,zhao2014formal,duggirala2014temporal,jeannin2015formally}.
%
%This is because hybrid automata is a well suited formalism for modeling satellite maneuver protocols. 
%
% The motion of satellite in each mode is modelled as a differential equation. 
%
% The change in mode of operation is modelled as a transition among these modes.
%

In this paper, we perform safety analysis of satellite rendezvous mission modeled as a hybrid automata.
%
Our analysis relies on computing an artifact called {\em reachable set}. 
%
Given a set of initial configurations (often uncountable) $\Theta$, the reachable set is the set of all possible configurations encountered by the system trajectories starting from $\Theta$. 
%
Since the reachable set is also an uncountable set, we compute a symbolic representation of the reachable set.
%
Often, symbolic representations of convex sets such as support functions~\cite{spaceex}, polytopes~\cite{Frehse05_phaver}, zonotopes~\cite{girard2006efficient}, etc. are used because operations such as linear transformation, intersection, and Minkowski sum can be easily performed over these representations.
%
%This is because operations such as linear transformation, intersection, and minkowski sum can be efficiently performed using such convex representations.


However, such convex representations are at a significant disadvantage while performing mode switches.
%
Consider the case of a satellite rendezvous mission that involves a mode switch from continue to abort.
%
This mode switch can happen at any time in a given interval. 
%
Due to this non-determinism, the initial set of states in the abort mode is a convex overapproximation of the reachable set. 
%
Often, this overapproximation is too conservative and hence, such reachable set computation is not useful in determining whether all the behaviors of the systems are safe. 
%
While some approaches tried to avoid computing intersections, to compute the reachable set~\cite{althoff2012avoiding}, one has to perform overapproximation, which often becomes very conservative.
%
%\sridhar{Probably a spaceEx figure for state space exploration might come in handy here.}

This paper exclusively focuses on improving the accuracy of the reachable set by presenting template based and convex hull based aggregation strategies for discrete transitions in linear hybrid automata.
%
We also present a data structure called Aggregated Directed Acyclic Graph (AGGDAG) and explain how aggdag helps us in implementing various deaggregation strategies. 
%for keeping track of aggregations and their dependence on the reachable set.
%
%Using AGGDAG, we present several deaggregation strategies based on the counterexamples generated for the safety specification. 
%
We also provide soundness and relative completeness guarantees of our reachable set computation algorithm.
%
We implement our strategies in a tool called HyLAA~\cite{bak2017hscc} and analyze a satellite rendezvous mission.
%
Analyzing this model is particularly difficult because of the nondeterminism in switching behavior.
%
In the literature only restricted models of such switching behavior were analyzed owing to the overapproximation created by the state of the art tools.


%This work on developing deaggregation strategies is crucial for performing safety analysis of a satellite rendezvous mission. 
%%
%\sridhar{Might have to be ommitted.} Due to the non-determinism in the mode switching, state of the art tools are only able to analyze restricted switching behavior of this satellite rendezvous mission.
%%
%We demonstrate that using the deaggregation strategies presented in this paper, we can perform accurate safety analysis very quickly.
